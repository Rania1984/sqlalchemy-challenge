for this challenge in the Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
 I had issue with station analysis # Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset and # Using the most active station id from the previous query # Query the last 12 months of temperature observation data for this station and plot the results as a histogram so I got help from chatgpt to fix this issue.
for the Part 2: Design Your Climate App
I faced problem with getting the results for /api/v1.0/stations so I got help from chatgpt.
